# Test Coverage Verification

## Overview
Verify test coverage meets 80%+ target and ensure core logic has comprehensive testing.

## Steps
1. **Coverage Analysis**
   - Run coverage reports
   - Identify uncovered lines
   - Analyze coverage by file/function
   - Check branch coverage

2. **Coverage Improvement**
   - Add tests for uncovered code
   - Focus on critical business logic
   - Test edge cases and error paths
   - Improve branch coverage

3. **Coverage Monitoring**
   - Set up coverage thresholds
   - Monitor coverage trends
   - Prevent coverage regression
   - Report coverage metrics

4. **Quality Assessment**
   - Review test quality, not just quantity
   - Ensure meaningful assertions
   - Test behavior, not implementation
   - Maintain fast test execution

## Coverage Commands
```bash
# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# View coverage in browser
npm run test:coverage:open

# Check coverage thresholds
npm run test:coverage:check

# Generate coverage badge
npm run test:coverage:badge
```

## Coverage Targets
- **Overall**: 80%+ line coverage
- **Core Logic**: 100% coverage
- **Critical Paths**: 100% coverage
- **Edge Cases**: Well covered
