# Prompt Logs Management

## Overview
Save implementation logs to maintain project history and knowledge sharing.

## Steps
1. **Create Log Entry**
   - Create file in `.prompts/` directory
   - Use format: `yyyy-mm-dd_feature-name.md`
   - Include implementation details and decisions

2. **Document Implementation**
   - Record key technical decisions
   - Include code snippets and examples
   - Note challenges and solutions

3. **Knowledge Sharing**
   - Document lessons learned
   - Include best practices discovered
   - Note areas for future improvement
