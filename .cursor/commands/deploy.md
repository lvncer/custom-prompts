# Deployment Preparation

## Overview
Prepare application for deployment with comprehensive testing and environment verification.

## Steps
1. **Build Verification**
   - Run production build
   - Verify build artifacts
   - Check bundle size and performance

2. **Environment Preparation**
   - Verify environment variables
   - Check database migrations

5. **Post-Deployment**
   - Verify functionality in production
   - Monitor error rates and performance
   - Update documentation
