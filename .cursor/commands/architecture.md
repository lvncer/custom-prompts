# System Architecture Design

## Overview
Design system architecture and select appropriate technology stack for the feature implementation.

## Steps
1. **System Design**
   - Design high-level architecture
   - Define component interactions
   - Plan data flow and storage

2. **Database Design**
   - Design data models using Prisma schema
   - Plan relationships and constraints
   - Consider Row Level Security (RLS) policies

3. **API Design**
   - Design REST endpoints or Server Actions
   - Define request/response schemas using Zod
   - Plan authentication and authorization

4. **Frontend Architecture**
   - Plan component hierarchy
   - Design state management approach
   - Consider Server vs Client Components

5. **Security & Performance**
   - Plan security measures
   - Consider caching strategies
   - Design for scalability
